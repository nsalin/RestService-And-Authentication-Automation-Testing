# RestService-And-Authentication-Automation-Testing

For the REST testing I used the services offered by http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and for the login tests the http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login

The directoy Documentation contains exemples for bug tracking (in case of you are not using any bug tracker) and an example of a basic Test Strategy Plan. The Test Strategy also contains the steps to run the tests.
